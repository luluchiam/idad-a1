        <h2>1. Information Design</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong><br />
          The ecosystem simulation serves as the primary canvas for the visual
          presentation of information. Instead of using heavy text, users can
          see what's happening (such as fish movement, algae growth, and water
          level) through colour, motion, and subtle environmental changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My opinion of the Designer’s Rationale:</strong><br />
          The designer prioritises minimalism and immersion, letting the system
          speak for itself. By avoiding information overload, it invites
          exploration and curiosity rather than instructing the user too
          directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong><br />
          The sidebar/tools panel uses clearer icons and organised menus for
          direct control, but the main simulation depends on visual data and
          intuitive learning. When put together, they produce a balance between
          presenting information in an exploratory and practical way.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Mapping</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong><br />
          Each tool or element like soil, water, animals is mapped directly to
          interactive icons in the sidebar. Dragging and clicking have
          predictable, physical-like results, adding water raises the level,
          adding a fish makes it swim, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My opinion of the Designer’s Rationale:</strong><br />
          I think that the designer wants to mirror real-world logic without
          needing tutorials. Like science experiments or sandbox games, this
          physical mapping promotes an organic, experimentation interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong><br />
          The tool icons provide clear features and consistent results, while
          interactions on the main canvas may seem less predictable like how a
          fish interacts with its environment, reflecting the complexity of
          nature vs. the simplicity of controls.

        <h2>3. Characterisation</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong><br />
          Elements in the simulation like fish, algae, or snails have subtle
          behaviors and appearances that give them “character.” Fish swim, algae
          grows, and particles float, creating a lively, dynamic world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My opinion of the Designer’s Rationale:</strong><br />
          The designer is trying to let the personality be shown through
          movement and interaction instead of text-based descriptions. This
          decision reflects a hands-off approach that encourages users to
          observe, deepening engagement through discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong><br />
          The ecosystem characters are detailed and animated to feel alive,
          while the tool UI remains neutral and clean, deliberately avoiding
          character to keep the focus on the simulation.

        <h2>4. Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong><br />
          Feedback is mostly visual and dynamic. For example, when adding a
          plant, you immediately see it appear. If the water becomes dirty, it
          changes color. Ecosystem health is shown through natural visual
          shifts, not alerts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My opinion of the Designer’s Rationale:</strong><br />
          This non-verbal feedback style makes the experience organic and
          immersive. The designer wants users to watch and learn, not get
          pop-ups or gamey stats. It suits the meditative tone of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong><br />
          Main simulation gives feedback through environmental change, which is
          slow and natural. Sidebar actions give immediate, clear feedback like
          an element appears or a tool is selected, which helps support the user
          in a more practical sense.

      <h1>ADULT SWIM</h1>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>1. Information Design</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong><br />
          When you first open the site, you’re immediately dropped into a
          strange, glitchy 3D world with no instructions or labels. It’s filled
          with distorted shapes, pink blobs, hands, and weird textures. There’s
          no clear goal or guidance, the interface relies completely on visual
          impact and atmosphere to pull the user in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My opinion of the Designer’s Rationale:</strong><br />
          The lack of immediate text or instructions is a deliberate choice to
          disorient and immerse the user. The designer wants this to reflect a
          postmodern design attitude prioritising experience and emotion over
          clarity. This pushes the user to learn by interacting, encouraging
          them to treat the interface as a digital art installation, not a
          traditional website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong><br />
          The main visual space (the distorted 3D world) uses heavy abstraction
          to convey atmosphere and mood with no explicit information. Any
          controls or triggers that appear later (such as when you interact or
          scroll) are more functional, but still minimal and artistically
          styled, continuing the ambiguity while guiding the user subtly.
        </p>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>2. Mapping</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong><br />
          You interact by clicking, dragging, and flinging a limp ragdoll across
          the screen. Sound blocks are arranged in a rhythm grid, and when the
          ragdoll hits them, different sounds are triggered depending on how and
          where it collides. Every motion feels physical and has an immediate
          effect on the sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My opinion of the Designer’s Rationale:</strong><br />
          The designer makes the mapping physical and intuitive. Dragging the
          ragdoll works like pulling a toy or puppet sort of mimics physics. The
          sound mapping uses spatial logic, where you hit affects how it sounds,
          creating a strong link between action and result.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong><br />
          The main canvas interactions (flinging the body) are exploratory and
          open-ended, while UI controls like the beat grid offer more
          structured, looped control like a music sequencer. One is chaotic and
          the other rhythmic.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>3. Characterisation</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong><br />
          The main “character” is a floppy, unconscious body that the user drags
          and throws through the space. It reacts with silly physics, bouncing
          and twisting around, giving it a strange, puppet-like personality. The
          surreal environment and exaggerated shapes add to its quirky and
          unsettling vibe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My opinion of the Designer’s Rationale:</strong><br />
          The designer wants the player’s avatar to be a performer and puppet.
          It's purposefully silly, making fun of control while allowing the
          character to express themselves through movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong><br />
          The ragdoll character is full of strange personality, while the grid
          and tools UI is sterile and graphic. The contrast helps focus
          emotional engagement on the main interactive element.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>4. Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong><br />
          The feedback comes through sound and motion. When the body hits a
          block, you hear a beat or melody that changes based on the location
          and speed of impact. The visual reactions like twitching, bouncing,
          and sound flashes immediately tell you that your action did something,
          even without words.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My opinion of the Designer’s Rationale:</strong><br />
          The designer is tightly connecting sound and motion, creating a
          cause-and-effect loop that’s satisfying and encourages repeat
          experimentation. It avoids traditional UI feedback (like buttons or
          alerts), instead embedding responses in the experience itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong><br />
          The main canvas gives organic, audiovisual feedback that feels like
          performance art.
